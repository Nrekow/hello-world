// Hello Reader! 

// My name is Nic, and the most interesting thing I've ever done is gathering the courage to pursue my passion of coding. 

// I am a Mountain Dew lover. Though I've never understood the name. It tastes neither like a Mountain, nor Dew, and I've had the dew of a mountain and it tasted nothing similiar as well. 

// Day 1: I've attempted to consult with the Mountain Dew can about it's name origin. He does not know, and recommends that I ask the 2 liter bottle. 

// Day 2: The 2 liter bottle was no more help than the can. He did suggest that I use Google. How does the 2 liter bottle know what Google is?
