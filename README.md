// Hello Reader! 

// My name is Nic, and the most interesting thing I've ever done is gathering the courage to pursue my passion of coding. 

// I am a Mountain Dew lover. Though I've never understood the name. It tastes neither like a Mountain, nor Dew, and I've had the dew of a mountain and it tasted nothing similiar as well.
